Malware that can repreduce itself in the network. It needs you to execute a program. It may or may not cause problems. Different types of viruses:
-Program viruses: part of an application
-Boot sector viruses: run automatically with the boot system
-Script viruses: contained inside the scripts
-Macro viruses: written in macro language
-Fileless virus: doesnt use any file nor write any software or malicious code, which makes it better at avoiding anti-virus detection, because those looks for program that write files. It operates in the memory, and 
is never installed in a file or application. Here's how it work: the user clicks on malicious website link which redirect him in a website that exploits a flash/java/windows vulnerability. It then lauches PowerShell 
and downloads payload in RAM. It then runs PowerShell scripts and executables in meory, exfiltrates data, and damages files. It finally adds an auto-start in the boot system.
-Worms: malware that self-replicates, doesnt need any user intervention. It uses the network as transmission medium. Worms grow as fast as the network and can take over many systems very quickly. ISD/IPS can prevent
their entry, but once they're in, those tools are pretty much useless.
