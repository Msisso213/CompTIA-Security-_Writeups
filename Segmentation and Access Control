-Segmentations can be physical, logical (network switches such as VLANS) or virtual (cloud based or cloud architecture). Those segmentation are important to limit the
accessibility of data, but also to minimize the impacts that an attacker could have. The segmentation is done easier using access control lists (ACLs) which is a list where
devices are grouped by categories, source IP, destination IP, etc.
-Allow list: no applications can run unless its approved
-Deny list: everything can run unless it is on the "bad" list
