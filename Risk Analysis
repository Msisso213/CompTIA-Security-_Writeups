-Qualitative risk assessment: a table such as this one can be done to evaluate:
Risk Factor      Impact      Annualized Rate of Occurrence      Cost of Controls      Overall Risk

-Quantitative risk assessment: same thing can be done using a quantitative table with those column title: Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO), Asset Value (AV), Exposure Factor (EF). For example, lets calculate the
Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) for a laptop with a 1000$ worth: the AV is 1000 * EF of 1.0 = 1000 SLE
The annualized loss expectancy (ALE) is the ARO * SLE. Lets say our ARO is 7, then ARO of 7* SLE of 1000 = 7000 ALE
-Impacts: life, property, safety, financial, etc.
-Risk appetite is a qualitative description for readiness to take a risk. Risk tolerance is usually larger from the risk appetite. An example to distinguish both is the speed limit. Lets say we have a speed limit of
60, this is the risk appetite. But police officer will only purchase you at 80 which is the risk tolerance.
