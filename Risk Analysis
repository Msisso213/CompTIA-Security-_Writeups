-Qualitative risk assessment: a table such as this one can be done to evaluate:
Risk Factor      Impact      Annualized Rate of Occurrence      Cost of Controls      Overall Risk

-Quantitative risk assessment: same thing can be done using a quantitative table with those column title: Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO), Asset Value (AV), Exposure Factor (EF). For example, lets calculate the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) for a laptop with a 1000$ worth:
The AV is 1000 * EF of 1.0 = 1000 SLE
The annualized loss expectancy (ALE) is the ARO * SLE. Lets say our ARO is 7, then ARO of 7* SLE of 1000 = 7000 ALE
