-Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): lets say we have many tools to prevent intrusion in the network (NGFW, IPS, vulnerability scanners, etc) and they all identify the same incident, the SCAP is a tool that 
recognize when many other tools recognize the same incident.
-Benchmarks: provide the bare minimum for security settings
-SIEM tools
-Anti-virus and anti-malware
-Data Loss Prevention (DLP): stop sensitive data from being "leaked". (usually we put them at endpoints.
-Vulnerability scanners
