-Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): let's say we have many tools to prevent intrusion in the network (NGFW, IPS, vulnerability scanners, etc) and they
all identify the same incident, the SCAP is a tool that recognize when many other tools recognize the same incident.
-Benchmarks: provide the bare minimum for security settings
-SIEM tools
-Anti-virus and anti-malwares
-Data Loss Prevention (DLP): stop sensitive data from being "leaked". Usually we put them at endpoints.
-Vulnerability scanners
