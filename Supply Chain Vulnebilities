-The supply chain contains many moving parts:raw materials, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, customers, consumers, and attackers can infect any step of the chain. A 
single infection can infect all the chain. Many organizations use work with service provider when they don't have the ressources/abilities to do something themself. Service
providers often have access to internal services which could be another vulnerability for an attacker. There are many different service providers such as network, 
payroll/accounting, cloud services, etc. Security measures should then also take those service providers into considerations.
-Every data is passing through a router or switch which makes their security very important.
