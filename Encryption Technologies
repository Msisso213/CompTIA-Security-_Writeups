-Most modern moderboards come with a hardware named Trusted Platform Module (TPM) which is specifically designed for cryptographic funtions (encryption, decryption, key storage, etc). 
-A TPM is used for a single device, but there is also a hardware named Hardware Security Module (HSM) which is used in large environments and also give cryptographic functionnalities to devices.
-There is also key managment system which can be cloud based that is used to manage all the stored keys.
