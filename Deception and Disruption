Deception refers to strategies to mislead attackers and protect systems from breaches by creating fake environments, data, or vulnerabilities to lure attackers away from real assets. Some common strategies are
the following:
-Honeypots -> decoy systems that simulate real systems to attract and analyze attackers which are oftenly machines.
-Honeynets -> a network of honeypots which makes the trap more complex and difficult for machines to distinguish it from the real system.
-Honeyfiles -> similar to honeypots, honeyfiles are files with fake information. An alert is then sent when the file is accessed.
Honeytokens -> its traceable data so when the data is transferred, we know where it goes.
