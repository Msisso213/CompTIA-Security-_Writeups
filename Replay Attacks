-Basically is when the attacker uses information of a client which he aquired using ARP poisoning, malware on the victim device, or other.
-Session hijacking (sidejacking): when a client starts a session in a server by providing credential, a server ID is created. An attackercould use this session ID to enter the
session of the client without providing credentials. A good way to avoid all of that is using encryption everywhere you can.
