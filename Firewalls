-Filter traffic by port number (traditional firewalls) or application (NGFW)
-Encrypt traffic
-Can also act as a router (layer 3)
-Firewall rules: they can be general or specific. A firewall will read the restrictions on the list starting for top to the bottom, so the specific rules as usually at the top. It is also common to have Access 
control lists (ACLs) which are groupings of categories (source IP, destination IP, port number, etc.) that we want to allow or deny traffic. Here is an example of firewall ruleset:
Rule Number      Remote IP      Remote Port      Local Port      Protocol      Action
    1               All             Any              22             TCP        Allow    -> this allow any traffic from remote IP/remote port using SSH
    2               All             Any              80             TCP        Allow    -> this allow any traffic from remote IP/remote port using HTTP
    3               All             Any              443            TCP        Allow    -> this allow any traffic from remote IP/remote port using HTTPS
    4               All             Any             3389            TCP        Allow    -> this allow any traffic from remote IP/remote port using Microsoft remote desktop
    5               All              53              Any            UDP        Allow    -> this allow any traffic from remote IP or remote port 53 using DNS
    6               All             123              Any            UDP        Allow    -> this allow any traffic from remote IP/remote port using NTP (Network Time Protocol)
    7               All                                            ICMP        Deny     -> this deny any traffic from remote IP using ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol (ping))
-IPS works similar to firewall. A firewall is about controlling access, while an IPS is focused on monitoring and responding to threats within allowed traffic (dropping malicious packets, blocking offending
IP addresses, etc).
