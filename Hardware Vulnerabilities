-Firmware: software inside the hardware. In often case, the vendors are the only ones who can fix it. Those vendors sometimes are not really concerned for cybersecurity vulnerabilities resulting in delayed patches.
-End of life (EOL) is when manufacturer stops selling a product. It doesnt mean that the manufacturer will stop making the patches.
-End of service life (EOSL) is when a manufacturer stop selling a product and stop offering support (patches and evrything related) for a product.
-VMs share similar vulnerabilities as their physical alternatives, but they also have their own such as local privilege escalations, command injection, information disclosure, and more)
-VM escape protection: refers to the breaking out of the VM and interact with the host operating system or hardware
-Hypervisor: its a hardware that manages the relationship between physical and virtual resources (ram, storage space, cpu availability, etc) These resources can be reused between VMs. Hypervisor host with max 4GB of 
RAM, supports three VMs with 2 GB of RAM (RAM is allocated and shared between VMs which mean only 4 total RAM is used, but some of it is used by many multiple machines).
