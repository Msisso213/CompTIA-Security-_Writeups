It's easy to manage a network when you're inside. But sometimes, we need to manage it from the outside. In those cases, we can use a jump server, which is a device in which
the security is very high that we can access from the outside using SSH, tunnel, VPN, or other stuff.
-Proxies: sit between the devices and the external network, it receives the users requests and sends the the requests on their behalf.
-Load balancer: devices that split the load evenly between the servers to have the best effciency, time response, to prevent failure, excessive power usage of a single server,
etc. It can recognize when a device fails and then split the workload between the remaining devices.
