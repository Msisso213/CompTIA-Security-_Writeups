-Refers to when an attacker sits between two devices that are communicating and see all communication between those two devices (also known as man-in-the-middle attack). The attacker can redirect the data, but he can
also modify the data without the sender even knowing.
-A type of on-path attack is the ARP poisoning: for this type, the attacker needs to be on the same subnet as you. ARP is the protocol that devices use to know each other MAC addresses to communicate. Here how this 
attack works: lets say we have two devices: a laptop with IP 192.168.1.9 with a MAC of c8:bc:c8:a7:38:d5 and a router with IP 192.168.1.1 and a MAC of 00:09:5b:d4:bb:fe. Since devices communicate with MAC, the first 
thing the laptop will do when connecting to a network is ask the entire network who has the IP address of 192.168.1.1 (addresses that finish with .1 are usually routers) and the device that has it to send its MAC
address. The router will receive this message and send its MAC address to the laptop, which will store it in a cache (ARP cache). This process (ARP protocol) is done again after some times. An attacker in the same 
network could send an ARP reply saying he is the device 192.168.1.1 (even if he is not) and send his MAC address to the laptop, which will replace the MAC address in its cache by the one of the attacker, since ARP
doesnt have any type of authentification function. The same process can happen in reverse (with the router doing an ARP request to the laptop and after the attacker sending an ARP reply to the router).
