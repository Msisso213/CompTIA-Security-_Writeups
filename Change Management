How to make a change in a network (upgrade software, patch, change firewall, etc.)? It needs a formal process to ensure the functionality of all application during and after the process.
Here are the steps (may vary):
-Request a form
-Purpose of the change (bug, risk, recent incidents, etc.)
-Identify the scope of the change
-Schedule date and time (minimize the downtime, preferably when the least people use the ressources, perhaps holiday are the best time since most people are not working)
-Determine affected system (a single computer, a whole department, etc)
-Analyse risks associated with the change (risk of the change, but also the risks if we dont make the change or delay it)
-Get approvial from control board
-User testing (we of course make testing before implementing the change in what we call a sandbox which is an environement for test before we actually implement the change)
***important to have a backout plan in case the change brings down the whole system
