-Authentification: prove you are who you say you are through identification (username) and authentification factors (password and other authentification factors). 
Sometimes we may even put a digital signature in a device (in big company that uses many devices) which will recognize the device. One device or software in the
organization is responsible to create to certificate and signature and to give it to the different "trusted devices".
-Authorization: after getting authentified, what access do we give you. This leads to authorization models (also called abstraction) which will be looked at later.
Basically authorization model is creating groups and give each group authorization to certain ressource. For example, someone working in the shipping department 
would be added in the shipping and receiving group. This group have authorization to different ressources such as creating shipping label, tracking shipment, 
view monthly shipping reports, etc. Si in the future, instead of manually giving authorization to each ressourche to every new employee, we just add them in a 
group that we had previously giving all the authrization to the needed ressources.
-Accounting: all information about what happened during the session (login time, data sent and received, loout time, etc.)
