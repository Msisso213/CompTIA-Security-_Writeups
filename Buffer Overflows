A buffer overflow is a programming error that occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to overwrite adjacent memory. This
can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities, as attackers can exploit this by crafting inputs that manipulate the program's execution flow, often
redirecting it to execute malicious code. By carefully controlling the input data, they can gain unauthorized access or control over the affected system.
