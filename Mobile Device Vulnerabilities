Really challenging to secure since they contain a lot of data, they are really small, constantly used/connected and always in motion. Mobile devices have many built-in protection. One way to breach in them is through
jailbreaking/rooting.
-Rooting is replacing android OS by another one while jailbreaking is replacing apple iOS by another one.
-Sideloading refers to installing application on mobile device outside of the playstore or itunes
